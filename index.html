            <p>
                The data for this page was gathered from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales"> Video Games Sales</a> on Kaggle. When cleaning the data, 
                I chose to keep the game titles separated by platform. That is, the same game, Call of Duty: Black Ops for example, remains as separate entries for Xbox, 
                Play Station, etc. Thus if it appears on the Top 10 list of games for a particular region, that will only include the copies sold for a particular console,
                not the game accross all platforms.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    My dashboard is able to answer the questions about videogame sales using bargraphs and pie charts. The buttons 
                    at the top of the page allow the user to select which region they would like to view data from: either global 
                    sales data, or data from individual regions like North America, Europe, Japan, and other. Depending of which 
                    region the user has selected, the first bargraph presents the top 10 games by sales volume in that particular
                    region. Below that, the pie chart then shows the portion of sales in that region which are of particular genres.
                    This allows my boss/the user to determine which genres are the most popular in different regions. Finally, my 
                    second pie chart allows the user to input a particular genre, and the pie chart switches to show which publishers 
                    are the best for the input genre. For this, I ultimately decided to limit the results to the top 10 publishers
                    for each genre, then combine the rest of the publishers into an "Other Publishers" catagory and display that on 
                    the pie chart as well.

                    The first reason D3 helpful was because it was pretty straight forward to make dynamic graphs. Setting up a 
                    setData function allowed me to pretty easily change between regions or genres all on the same graph. 
                    <br><br>
                    Another reason D3 was helpful was that the mouseover feature allowed you to make less cluttered graphs.
                    Instead of having to put all the information of the screen at once, it was much cleaner to have the 
                    relavent information only show up when the user selected it. I think this helps with accessibility and
                    readability as the viewer can see only the necessary data at first, then choose to see more by hovering.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, D3 is extrememly powerful and gives you creative and analytical control. It has a ton of different graph 
                    types you can make, some of which are very cool. The map for example, is a graph type I wish I would have had time 
                    to try to implement. It's an extremely unique way to show data, and with the tools of D3, is less complex than I 
                    thought it would have been. That is something I will probably play with outside the scope of this class.
                </li><br><br>
                <li>
                    For me personally, I think D3 wouldn't be the best tool for creating a visualization because of how the
                    programmer has to manually style everything. While its very robust with all the options and customizability, I think 
                    it can be very complicated at times to get the program to do what you want, and especially for someone who had never
                    used it before, took me forever to figure out which atrributes and styles I needed to add. On this same thought,
                    I think another reason it might not be the best tool is because there are other tools which streamline the process a 
                    little more and might easier to work with. This might include other JavaScript packages, or even Python chart packages
                    which might be a little more intuitive to use.
                    <br><br>
                    Further, in order to make really visually appealing webpages, you have to be really handy with HTML and know how to 
                    create elements within your javascript file and D3 elements, which I am not. I struggled a bit with creating the HTML 
                    elements for the mouseover elements and couldn't quite get them how I wanted, as long as struggled with creating classes 
                    in general.
                    <br><br>

                <li>
                    I think my dashboard is accessible to red/green color blind people, which is the most common type of color blindness. 
                    When picking my color scheme, I wanted something that would be visually appealing for the normal eye, but also for red/
                    green color blindness. Thus, I chose a Navy and Yellow color scheme. However, this would make it less accessible for the more rare
                    type of color blindness blue/yellow.
                    <br><br>
                    One action I took to make my webpage more accessible was adding text for each graph breifly explaining what the graph 
                    shows, and how you can change the data shown. For example, in my bar graph and my Genre Pie Chart, I explained that you 
                    could change which region you wanted the data to describe by using the buttons at the top of the page. As the article 
                    "Why Accessibility Is at the Heart of Data Visualization" explained, I wanted to provide a short summary such that there
                    was no confusion of what my graph showed, or how to use it. I wanted to make sure that the user didn't have to figure out 
                    how it worked by themselves, and instead, save some time and clearly explain it for them.
                    <br><br>
                    Another action I took was to include a section after my graphs explicitly letting the viewer know where I got my data, and
                    how it was processed. I did this so that I was clear how I might be manipulating or employing the data so that any confusion 
                    over what data is actually presented is minimized.
                </li><br><br>
                <li>
                    One thing I think I could have done better would be choosing a color scheme with more contrast, as that would make it easier
                    for color blind people of all types to access my visual data. Additionally, for blind people who use screen readers, I'm sure my HTML layout
                    could have been more optimal/easier for a screen reader to navigate correctly. When writing the HTML for my dashboard, I was
                    making it as I went and threw elements I thought I needed kind of randomly. I think I could have made a better, more 
                    efficient HTML doc if I had planned out what I wanted to do more, instead of deciding as I went through the project.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, I tried to add a mouseover feature for my last graph, the pie chart showing the best publishers. For whatever
                    reason, I couldn't get it to display and I honestly don't know why. This definitely affects the accessibility, and with more 
                    time, I would have fixed this. Again, I'm not sure why it doesn't work in the first place since its basically the same as the 
                    mouseover feature from the first pie chart.
